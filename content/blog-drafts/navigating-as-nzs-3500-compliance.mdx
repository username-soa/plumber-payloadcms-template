When you hire a plumber in Australia, you aren't just paying for their time; you are paying for their license to certify that work complies with **AS/NZS 3500**. Often referred to as the "Plumbing Code of Australia," this set of standards governs everything from the angle of your drain pipes to the temperature of water coming out of your bathroom tap.

But why should a homeowner care about technical standards? The answer lies in safety, insurance coverage, and the resale value of your property.

  A **Certificate of Compliance** (or eCC) is a legal document your plumber must issue for most gas and plumbing work (different thresholds apply by state, e.g., >$750 value in VIC). This is your guarantee—and your insurer's requirement—that the work meets federal standards.

## The Evolution of Plumbing Safety

Our standards haven't always been this strict. They have evolved over decades in response to public health needs and environmental challenges.

## Identifying Non-Compliant Work

We often get called to fix extensive damage caused by "handyman specials" or unlicensed renovations. Non-compliant plumbing is not just ugly; it's dangerous. Common violations include S-traps without venting (leading to sewer smells), stormwater connected to sewer (illegal), and lack of backflow prevention.

## The Real Cost of Cutting Corners

It might be tempting to save money by hiring an unlicensed friend, but the long-term risks far outweigh the short-term savings.

## How to Vet Your Plumber

Protecting yourself is simple if you know what to look for. Use this checklist before hiring anyone to work on your pipes or gas.

### A Cautionary Tale

We recently helped a client in Brisbane who learned this the hard way.

Don't become a statistic. Ensure your home is safe and compliant.
