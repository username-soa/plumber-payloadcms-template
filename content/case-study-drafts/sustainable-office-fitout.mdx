## The Vision

GreenTech Solutions wanted their new Melbourne headquarters to reflect their values. The brief was simple but ambitious: achieve a **6-Star Green Star rating**. This required a hydraulic design that reduced potable water consumption by at least 60% compared to a standard office.

## Project Scope

Our team was engaged to design and construct the plumbing infrastructure for:
*   Male & Female Amenities
*   End-of-Trip Facilities (Showers for cyclists)
*   Staff Kitchen & breakout areas
*   Rainwater Harvesting System

  The project targeted a maximum consumption of 15 litres per person/day. Standard office consumption is typically 40-50L.
</Callout>

## Implementation

We deployed a range of smart fixtures and systems to meet the target.

### 1. Rainwater Harvesting
We installed a 10,000L tank in the basement to capture roof runoff. This water is filtered and pumped back up to flush all toilets in the building, reducing mains water usage by 40%.

### 2. Smart Fixtures
Sensor-activated tapware isn't just hygienic; it prevents taps being left running. We specified 6-star WELS rated fixtures throughout.

### 3. Leak Detection
A smart flow-monitoring system was integrated into the Building Management System (BMS). If water flow is detected after hours, the BMS alerts the facility manager and automatically shuts the solenoid valve at the main meter.

## Challenges & Solutions

Working in a high-rise CBD building presents unique logistical challenges.

## The Outcome

The office opened on time and under budget. The initial data shows water consumption is tracking at just 12L per person/day, exceeding the efficiency target.
