## The Challenge

The Thompson family live in a stunning Federation-era home in Paddington. They were experiencing recurring sewer blockages that were becoming a weekly nightmare.

A CCTV drain inspection revealed the cause: aggressive tree roots from a protected Jacaranda tree had crushed the 100-year-old earthenware pipes. The traditional repair method would have required excavating a 15-meter trench right through their pristine, original tessellated tile driveway.

  Restoring the heritage driveway tiles after excavation was estimated to cost over $15,000 alone, on top of the plumbing costs. A trenchless solution was the only viable option.

## Our Solution: Trenchless Relining

We proposed "Inversion Pipe Relining"—essentially building a new, structural pipe inside the old damaged one, without digging a single hole.

### The Process

1.  **High-Pressure Cleaning**: We used a 5000 PSI hydro-jet to cut away the tree roots and scour the old pipe walls clean.
2.  **Liner Calibration**: A custom epoxy-resin impregnated liner was measured to the exact length of the damaged section.
3.  **Inversion**: Using compressed air, we "inverted" (blew) the liner into the pipe.
4.  **Curing**: Hot water was circulated through the liner to cure the resin, creating a rock-hard seamless pipe within 4 hours.

## Visualizing the Repair

The difference in flow efficiency is dramatic. The new lining is smoother than PVC and completely joint-free, meaning tree roots can never penetrate it again.

## Outcomes

By choosing relining over excavation, the client saved weeks of disruption and over $10,000 in restoration costs.
