## The Challenge

On a freezing Tuesday morning in August, the facility manager of Sunnybank Hills Aged Care contacted us at 5:30 AM. Their primary industrial hot water manifold had failed, leaving 50 vulnerable residents without warm water for heating, showering, or sanitation.

In an aged care environment, hot water is not a luxury—it's a critical health requirement. The facility was facing potential evacuation if the system wasn't restored by evening.

  The replacement had to be fully compliant with AS/NZS 3500.4 regarding heated water temperature control for vulnerable people (maximum 45°C delivery to ensuite points).

## Technical Implementation

We replaced the failing storage units with a high-efficiency continuous flow manifold system. This setup ensures redundancy—if one unit fails in the future, the others pick up the load, guaranteeing 99.9% uptime.

## The Result

Hot water was restored to all wings of the facility by 12:30 PM, well before the afternoon shift change. The new system is 30% more energy-efficient, projected to save the facility over $4,000 annually in gas bills.
